# ChemicalFormulaSimplification
A simple JS code to simplify chemical formula.

I got this question in one of the interviews. I was not able to solve it in time then. But I thought I will take a stab at it.
This is what I have come up with.

Running this file is simple. Just set the formula variable and run using node.
